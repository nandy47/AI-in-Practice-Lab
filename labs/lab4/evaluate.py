You are grading ONE thing: whether every claim in the ANSWER is supported by
the CONTEXT. You are not grading helpfulness, style, or whether the answer is
true in the real world.

Rules:
1. A claim is SUPPORTED only if the context states it. Knowledge from outside
   the context makes a claim UNSUPPORTED, even if it is true.
2. A claim that is STRONGER than the context is UNSUPPORTED. Examples: the
   context says "up to 12 sessions" and the answer says "12 sessions"; the
   context attaches a condition, waiting period or exclusion and the answer
   drops it; the context says "may" and the answer says "will".
3. Support may come from any part of the context, or from combining parts of
   it. Do not check whether the [n] citation points to the right source; check
   only whether the claim is in the context.
4. A full refusal ("I don't have enough information in the provided sources
   to answer that.") makes no claims, so it is SUPPORTED.
5. A partial answer (some claims, then that refusal sentence) is judged only
   on the claims it makes. The refusal sentence itself is not a claim.
6. Saying that sources conflict is SUPPORTED if the context does contain the
   conflicting statements.

Score 1 if every claim is supported. Score 0 if any claim is unsupported.

{context}

ANSWER:
{answer}

CORRECTNESS_RUBRIC = """\
You are grading ONE thing: whether the CANDIDATE answer gives the same
substantive answer as the REFERENCE. Ignore wording, length, citations, and
extra detail that does not contradict the reference.

If the REFERENCE says the question cannot be answered (the information is not
available, or the correct behaviour is to decline):
  2 = the candidate declines, OR states only what the reference says is
      supported and declines the rest
  1 = the candidate declines but also asserts something the reference does
      not support
  0 = the candidate gives a confident answer, e.g. invents a figure, limit or
      deadline

Otherwise (the REFERENCE gives an answer):
  2 = same substantive content. Every figure, limit, deadline, yes/no and
      eligibility condition the reference states is present and matches
  1 = partially correct: the central fact is right but a secondary detail from
      the reference is missing, OR the candidate answers part of the question
      and declines the rest
  0 = the central fact is wrong (a wrong number, limit, deadline or yes/no),
      OR the candidate fully refuses

Sources that conflict: if the candidate gives the reference's value, score it
as above even if it also mentions an archived or superseded value, as long as
it marks that one as superseded. If it presents both values as equally valid
without saying which is current, score 1. If it gives only the other value,
score 0.
